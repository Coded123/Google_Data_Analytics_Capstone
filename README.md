Title:  Cyclistic bike-share analysis

Date: 9 April 2022

# Background 
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

# Business task 
Analyse bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and identify trends. Then design a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members

# Deliverables 
1.	A clear summary of the business task
2.	A description of all data sources used
3.	Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4.	A summary of analysis
5.	Supporting visualisations and key findings
